# Ansible Role: Exim

[![CI](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-exim/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-exim/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Installs Exim (a Mail Transfer Agent) on RedHat/CentOS or Debian/Ubuntu.

## Requirements

None.

## Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see `defaults/main.yml`):

    exim_dc_eximconfig_configtype: internet

(Debian/Ubuntu only) Main configuration type. Should be 'internet' for public mail sending, or 'local' if mail should only be delivered locally. See Exim documentation for other options.

    exim_dc_localdelivery: mail_spool

(Debian/Ubuntu only) Default transport for local mail delivery. Defaults to `mail_spool` if unset.

    exim_primary_hostname: ""

Force a primary server hostname for Exim. Usually you don't need to set this, but if Exim can't reliably determine the FQDN of your server, you can set this and it will ensure Exim uses the correct hostname.
